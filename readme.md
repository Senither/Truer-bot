### Installing Truer Bot

I don't know why you would want to self-host this... Anyways here is how you can setup the bot yourself... \*Sigh\*

Start by cloning the bot and going into the `truer-bot` directory.

    git clone https://github.com/Senither/Truer-bot.git

Next, install the dependencies using Yarn or NPM.

    yarn

And now run the bot with your Discord token following the file name.

    node bot.mjs <your discord token goes here>

And that's it.

### Another Dumb Bot

For another dumb bot, check out [Smiler](https://github.com/Senither/Smiler-bot), the bot that replies with a smiley face to everything, or [Falser](https://github.com/senither/Falser-bot) which is a bot that replies with "False!" to everything.
